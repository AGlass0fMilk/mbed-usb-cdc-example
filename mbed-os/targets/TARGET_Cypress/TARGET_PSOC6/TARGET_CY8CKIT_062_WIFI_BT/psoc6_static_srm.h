 * This file defines hardware resources reserved by device-generated code. These
 * resources are accessed directly by the Peripheral Driver library (PDL).
 *
 * There are four classes of resources that must be declared here:
 *  1 CYCFG_ASSIGNED_PORTS macro defines which ports and pins are reserved.
 *    You define these as a colon separated list of ports and pins reserved
 *    using macro SRM_PORT(port_num, pins), once for each reserved port.
 *    SRM_PORT macro arguments are port number (in the range 0 ... 14) and
 *    pins, which is a hex value with a bit set for each reserved pin on a port.
 *
 *  2 CYCFG_ASSIGNED_DIVIDERS macro defines which clock dividers are reserved.
 *    You define these as a colon separated list of dividers reserved
 *    using macro SRM_DIVIDER(type, reservations), once for each required
 *    divider type.
 *    SRM_DIVIDER arguments are divider type (one of cy_en_divider_types_t
 *    values) and reservations, which is a hex mask value with a bit set for 
 *    each reserved divider of a given type.
 *
 *  3 CYCFG_ASSIGNED_SCBS macro defines which SCB blocks are reserved.
 *    You define these as a colon separated list of SCBs reserved using
 *    macro SRM_SCB(n), which argument is SCB number in a range 0 ... 7.
 *
 *  4 CYCFG_ASSIGNED_TCPWM macro defines which TCPWM blocks are reserved.
 *    You define these as a colon separated list of TCPWMs reserved using
 *    macro SRM_TCPWM(n), which argument is TCPWM number in a range 0 ... 31.
 *
 * Examples:
 *    #define CYCFG_ASSIGNED_PORTS		SRM_PORT(0, 0x30), SRM_PORT(5, 0x03)
 *
 *    #define CYCFG_ASSIGNED_DIVIDERS	SRM_DIVIDER(CY_SYSCLK_DIV_8_BIT, 0x01)
 *
 *	  #define CYCFG_ASSIGNED_SCBS		SRM_SCB(2)
 *
 *    #define CYCFG_ASSIGNED_TCPWMS
 *
